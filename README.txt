# Car Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting car prices based on various features. Using a dataset of car sales, the project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and builds multiple regression models to predict the price of a car. It employs models such as **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest Regressor**, and **Decision Tree Regressor**. 

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and removing irrelevant columns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends and correlations between car price and other features.
- **Machine Learning Models**: 
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Decision Tree Regressor
- **Model Evaluation**: Using performance metrics like RMSE, RÂ², and visualization of actual vs predicted prices.
- **Data Visualization**: Various plots to visualize the relationship between car price and features like horsepower, engine size, and curb weight.

## Steps Covered
1. **Data Import**: Load car sales data from CSV.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing data, rename columns, and fix data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize correlations between car price and features.
4. **Model Training**: Train models using selected features, evaluate performance, and visualize results.
5. **Model Comparison**: Compare multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree).
6. **Visualization**: Visualize results to make conclusions about model performance.
